## Interview Task

Please design and build a single-page web application with React to help second graders practice their addition skills. Your application will simply present a student (the user) with a single mathematical expression and then provide feedback about whether they submitted the correct answer. Please document the application and your planning process.

## Application

- This application will be quite simple; it will consist of a single question, a text box for the student to provide a response, and a submit button.
- Two integers A and B will be randomly generated and the expression `A + B = ` will be presented to the student to which they will be prompted to provide an answer in the text box.
- The application will use the mathjs.org API to check the submitted answer (https://api.mathjs.org/).
- It should be obvious to the student how to use your application, whether their provided answer is correct, and if an error occurred.

## Documentation

Provide a README.md detailing:

- What your application does;
- How other developers could contribute to your code base (installing dependencies, spinning up a development server, running tests, etc.);
- How to build and deploy your application.

## Planning

Provide a planning.md file that gives insight into how you planned to build this application, including brief details on how the user interacts with the interface and how the services communicate. This does not need to be polished; a photo of a whiteboard sketch or two with an accompanying story is sufficient.

Discuss how you would add one or two of the following enhancements to your application:
 - Generating more complex math problems
 - Maintaining a history of questions
 - Keeping a running total score
 - Giving multiple questions at once
 - Adding a timer
 - Limiting the number of incorrect answers


## Ownership

Your submission will be used for assessment purposes only, and you have complete ownership of the ideas/work you submit. However, we do ask that you don't publish this project or push your work to GitHub, so we can continue to use the assignment.
